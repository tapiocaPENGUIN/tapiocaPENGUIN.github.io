          <p id="remove">
          We are team Velocirapter and we decided to make and education website that focuses
          on teaching the game of American football. We implemented a Pixi/JavaScript game
          which allows you to run different routes and offensive formations against varying
          defensive formations. We are rag-tag team that joined forces at the last minute.
          We hope that you learn something from our website!

          <p id="faq"> 1. The Arizona Cardinals had the longest postseason victory
            drought in NFL history (1947 to 1998).<br>
            2. There have been 14 different rushing champions in the past 17 years.
            There were 14 different champions in the 27 years before that.<br>
            3. Julio Jones has three more catches through three weeks of the NFL season (34)
            than anyone else in history and is on pace for 181 catches this
            season, which is only 38 ahead of the NFL record, which should
            tell you something about Marvin Harrison’s remarkable 2002. <br>
            4. Sammy Baugh once led the NFL in passing, punting and defensive interceptions in the same season. <br>
            5. The Chicago Bears have the most retired numbers of any NFL team with 13.<br>
            6. Five teams don’t have any players’ numbers retired. Three are
            due to a lack of history: Baltimore, Houston and Jacksonville. The
            other two are because the teams don’t “believe” in such honor: Dallas and Oakland.<br>
            7. Jerry Rice and Brett Favre are the only non-kickers to play in more than 300 games.<br>
            8. Emmitt Smith still won the rushing title in 1993, the year he
            held out the first two games of the season in a contract dispute.<br>
            9. Steve Young is the only left-handed quarterback in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.<br>
            10. Andrew Luck already has more playoff passing yards than two-time Super Bowl champion Bart Starr.<br>
